    <h1>The Goth 90s</h1>
    <p>
      I'm not really sure when I became aware of it. I am pretty sure that I
      noticed the clothing and attitude before I had ever heard the word "Goth".
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the pop culture examples that sticks in my mind is Darlene from the
      show Roseanne. A girl who wore black and had a somewhat gloomy outlook on
      life. But did she ever call herself Goth? I don't believe she did. When I
      was 13 in the early 90s, I wore black on a regular basis and had an
      interest in some dark subject matter. Someone said to me, "Ben, you wear
      black everyday. You're evil." But I didn't call myself Goth at the time.
      I'm fairly certain I had never heard the word at that point. And there
      were older youths who would swear that people who fit my description
      weren't "Real Goths". I hadn't met them yet though. Like I said, at that
      point I had yet to hear the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to high school things were different. Whether it was our age or
      a shift in the overall culture, styles changed. Now you had more people
      dying their hair unusual colors, spiking it, wearing lipstick and makeup
      that was far from traditional. You also had people who fit the goth
      stereotype far better than I had as a middle school student.
      Interestingly, these people did not usually call themselves goths. That
      was a label placed on them by others. One friend of mine called another
      who he disliked a "poser goth". Now my friend who was disdainful of the
      "poser" could also be described as goth, but denied being one. He
      expressed some dislike for them. And my other friend, the "poser"? I
      hadn't yet heard him describe himself as goth either, although later, when
      we were both adults, he said his style might be described that way.
    </p>
    <p>So where did that put me? I'm not really sure. I was peripherally associated with this mass of gothy kids, who
       may or may not have been goths. There was definitely some overlap between "goths" and weird nerds, and I
       pretty solidly fell into the latter camp. But that camp was much less cohesive; it was more descriptor than
       social grouping, although in high school the concepts couldn't be completely disentangled.</p>

    <h2>Pop Culture And Antecedents</h2>
    <p>So where does this come from? Vampires seem to be a running theme in the pop culture of the 90s. The
       Anne Rice novel Interview With The Vampire came out in 1976, but the movie based on it was released in
       1994. The White Wolf game Vampire: the Masquerade spawned a short-lived television show produced by
       Aaron Spelling. Marilyn Manson first became big in the 90s, and rightly or not, he became associated with
       the subuclture also. Now the subculture existed in the late 70s and 80s also, or a broadly similar one that
       shared a name did, depending on how you choose to look at it.</p>

   <p>In the William Gibson sci-fi novel Count Zero, there is a gang called the Gothiks. The novel was published in
      1986. William Gibson's novels were also popular among the 90s goths, perhaps because of the growing
      popularity of the internet. Gibson has been credited with presaging the then current version of the internet
      and coining the word "cyberspace". Count Zero was part of his Sprawl trilogy, the second book, the last book
      in the series being published in 1988. Gibson was also credited with launching the cyberpunk genre, which
      may also have been a word coined by him. The Gothiks of Count Zero strive for a uniform look, the
      description of which was perhaps a nod to stereotypes of the time, perhaps an influence of those yet to come,
      although not identical in my experience. In the Gibson novel they alter their faces through plastic surgery
      which is widely available, cheap, and effective; the protaganist has difficulty telling them apart. They try for
      a certain look in other ways also. In the words of the author:</p>

   <blockquote>" lean, muscular, but touched by a certain gaunt restlessness, young athletes in the early stages of
      consumption. The graveyard pallor was mandatory, and Gothick hair was by definition black. Bobby knew
      that the few who couldnâ€™t warp their bodies to fit the subcultural template were best avoided; a short Gothick
      was trouble, a fat Gothick homicidal."</blockquote>

   <p>Neil Gaiman's Sandman series was also popular in the 90s. Although the first issue was released in 1988, the
      series ran until 1996, with spinoffs being published later. The character Death often being described as
      looking like a cheerful goth girl. The character first appears in issue #8 in 1989. In a testament to the series'
      and character's growing cultural currency, two spinoff series centered around Death were published in the
      1990s. When they were collected into book form, the forewards were written by Tori Amos and Claire
      Danes. When the character is revisted in on of the stories in Gaiman's Endless Nights (published in 2003),
      she is depicted without the goth look, but a very grim and downcast disposition, inverting the stereotypes.</p>

    <h2>And Where Did They Go?</h2>
    <p>The subculture continued into the aughts, with greater media visibility. Now you have characters who are
      clearly referred to as goth within the media they appear in. Sometimes they're played for laughs, sometimes
      not. My goth-looking friends who didn't call themselves goths in highschool, even made their disdain for
      goths clear, now referred to themselves as goths. I noticed something else too though. I was seeing fewer and
      fewer kids who you would clearly describe as goth. The goths I ran into were almost all around my age.
      Curious, I googled to see if other people had noticed this; they had. I found a message board or blog post
      where someone else had asked that question, "Where did the goth kids go?" One of the answers: "Maybe the
      same place the hippies and greasers did."</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, years later, I heard someone make the point that teenagers who would have been absorbed into
      the goth subculture at one time were now being absorbed into different ones. In the novel Neuromancer, also
      written by William Gibson and part of the same trilogy Count Zero was, the main character muses on the
      similarities and differences between the youth of his present-day and his compatriots when he was a
      teenager:</p>

    <blockquote>"There was a kind of ghostly teenage DNA at work in the Sprawl, something that carried the coded precepts
      of various short-lived sub cults and replicated them at odd intervals"</blockquote>
